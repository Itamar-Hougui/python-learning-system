# Weekly Summary — {3}

## Highlights

- learning about these new ways to solve problems!

## Challenges

- This topic is very time consuming and requires more than I can spare during a semester to truly understand it.

## Learnings

- learnt about asymptotic notation.
- learnt about different data structures.
- learnt about recursion.

## Next Week’s Goals

- going back to project based learning of python rather than keep on algorithms.
- over the summer will revisit this topic in more depth.
