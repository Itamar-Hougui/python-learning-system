## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- learn about linked lists and queues

## ðŸ“š What I Did

1. learned about linked lists, both doubly and singly.
2. learned about queues.

## ðŸ¤” Reflections

- have decided that before I continue with the mini projects of python I will first finish learning different data structures and basic algorithms in order to try and produce better quality projects and practice the implementation of those concepts.
