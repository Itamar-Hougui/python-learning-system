## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Wrapping up algorithms and data structures for the time being.

## ðŸ“š What I Did

1. Finished the basics of algorithms and data structures.

## ðŸ¤” Reflections

- After learning a little bit of algorithms and data structures I came to the decision for the time being it will be more effective to do project based learning of python instead.
- Will come back to algorithms and data structures in the summer when there is more time and will study these topics in more rigorous manner.
