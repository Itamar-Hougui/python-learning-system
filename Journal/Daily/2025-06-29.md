# Daily Journal â€” {2025-06-29}

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Setting up the system.
- Start learning syntax, variables, io, etc.

## ðŸ“š What I Did

1. covered data types
2. io
3. type casting
4. assignment operators
5. arithmetic operators
6. round
7. f strings (add f in front of the string and to print variable put them in {})

## ðŸ¤” Reflections

- remeber difference between // (int outcome) and / (float outcome)
- ** is power
- casting: data_type(thing to cast)
- round(thing to round,n of digits)
