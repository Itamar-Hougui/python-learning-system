# Daily Journal â€” {2025-07-08}

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- start learning about OOP in python
- learn about reading and writing files

## ðŸ“š What I Did

1. covered reading and writing files (txt, CSV, json)
2. covered basics of OOP, will continue with it more later.

## ðŸ¤” Reflections

- while the concepts of OOP stay the same, so far python way of doing it is a bit weird for me compared with C++, maybe as I will read more I will like it as much as C++ :D
- tomorrow mainly work on projects, from now on covering OOP, and starting data structures and algorithms as well.
